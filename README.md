### Date created
Friday, the 15th of January, 2021.

### Project Title
Github Project: pdsnd_github

### Description
Comming from "Front End Developer" path, end project in the "1. Pre-requisite: Git and Github" chapter.
But with difficulties: The tasks are actually made for the Data Science Nanodegree, so there should be a Python file included. So I just created the bikeshare.py in Git (touch) and entered some gibberish (comment and a print statement, nothing more)! I hope it is sufficient in order to perform a commit! Refactoring of the code is, well, not possible without the codeâ€¦

### Files used
README.md  bikeshare.py .gitignore
